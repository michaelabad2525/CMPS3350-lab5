# Turn Based Combat (Website)

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a old school Street Fighter like background and sprites but with a twist. Instead of a regular fighting game, we turned it into a turn based combat system similar to that of a JRPG. 


## Deployment

To deploy this project run the HTML file locally or from a public_html directory
